## Background Information   
  
Paddlefish (family Polyodontidae) are basal Chondrostean ray-finned fish. They have been referred to as "primitive fish" because they have evolved with few morphological changes since the earliest fossil records of the Late Cretaceous, seventy to seventy-five million years ago. Polyodontids are exclusively North American and Chinese.

_Image: Paddlefish swimming in stream._   
  
There are two extant species, the American paddlefish ( _Polyodon spathula_ ) which is native to the Mississippi River basin in the U.S. and the critically endangered Chinese paddlefish ( _Psephurus glades_ ) which is endemic to the Yangtze River Basin in China. Chinese paddlefish are also commonly referred to as "Chinese swordfish", or "elephant fish".  
  
Paddlefish populations have declined dramatically throughout their historic range as a result of overfishing, pollution, and the encroachment of human development, including the construction of dams that have blocked their seasonal upward migration to ancestral spawning grounds. Other detrimental effects include alterations of rivers which have changed natural flows resulting in the loss of spawning habitat and nursery areas. Chinese paddlefish have not been seen since 2007, and may now be extinct (or functionally extinct in the wild) for many of the same reasons that have plagued the American species.  
  
American Paddlefish are found throughout the Missouri and Mississippi river basins which drain most of the central United States. Twenty-two states have paddlefish, and Montana is the most westerly state with them. Several states are trying to reintroduce them into areas where they have disappeared.

### Montana Distribution Map   
In Montana, paddlefish are found in the Yellowstone River as far upriver as Forsyth as well as the Missouri River above and below Fort Peck Dam. Fish above Fort Peck Dam (known as the Fort Peck stock) are now isolated from fish below the dam, although some upriver fish can pass downstream. An important recreational snag fishery exists for this stock in areas near the Fred Robinson Bridge. The downstream fish are part of the population inhabiting the Yellowstone River and Lake Sakakawea, known as the Yellowstone-Sakakawea stock. An important recreational snag fishery exists for this stock at Intake Diversion Dam, near Glendive.

For this study, paddlefish were caught at a recreational snag fishery on the Missouri River in Fergus county, Montana.

## Paddlefish Age Technique Analysis   
Unfortunately, none of my code for my analysis worked.   
   
## Alternate Analysis   
Since my code for the paddlefish didn't work, I am including code running a different analysis.   
   
### About the Data

**"Growth responses of a green alga to multiple environmental drivers" by GL Brennan and S Collins**   

#### Abstract   
   
One feature of global change is that biota must respond not to single, but to multiple environmental drivers. By growing a model photosynthetic microbe in environments containing between one and eight different drivers, including changes in CO2, temperature, and pH, in different combinations, we show that the number as well as the identities of drivers explain shifts in population growth rates. This is because the biotic response to multiple environmental drivers depends on the response to the single dominant driver, and the chance of a driver of large effect being present increases with the number of drivers. Interactions between drivers slightly counteract the expected drop in growth. Our results demonstrate that population growth declines in a predictable way with the number of environmental drivers, and provide an empirically supported model for scaling up from studies on organismal responses to single drivers to predict responses to large numbers of environmental drivers.

### Analysis   

```{r Set up Code}
data<-read.csv("E:/BIOL5700R/Paddlefish/DataDryad_mixed_model_290415.csv", header = T) 

CO2<-subset(data, Co2!="yes" )

CO2<-subset(data,Co2=="yes")
CO2_Temp<-subset(CO2,Temp=="yes")
CO2_Temp_pH<-subset(CO2_Temp,pH=="yes")
CO2_pH<-subset(data,pH=="yes")

cpx1<-subset(data,NED ==1)
CO2_Temp_pH<-rbind(CO2_Temp_pH, cpx1CO2<-subset(cpx1,Co2=="yes"))
CO2_Temp_pH<-rbind(CO2_Temp_pH, cpx1pH<-subset(cpx1,pH=="yes"))
CO2_Temp_pH<-rbind(CO2_Temp_pH, cpx1Temp<-subset(cpx1,Temp=="yes"))

cpx2<-subset(data,NED ==2)
CO2_Temp_pH<-rbind(CO2_Temp_pH, cpx2CO2pH<-subset(cpx2,Co2=="yes"& pH=="yes"))
CO2_Temp_pH<-rbind(CO2_Temp_pH, cpx2CO2Temp<-subset(cpx2,Co2=="yes"& Temp=="yes"))
CO2_Temp_pH<-rbind(CO2_Temp_pH, cpx2TemppH<-subset(cpx2,Temp=="yes"& pH=="yes"))

case<-CO2_Temp_pH

str(data)

summary(data)

boxplot(data$Rate.of.Division,ylab="Rate.of.Division")

qqnorm(data$Rate.of.Division,main="NormalQ-Q Plot",ylab="Rate.of.Division")
qqline(data$Rate.of.Division)
```

Let's start by checking for co-linearity.  

```{r Check for Co-linearity}
pairs(data[,2:14], lower.panel = NULL)
```

Treatment and Regime look closely related, as do NED and Overlap, NED and Replicate, and Overlap and Replicate. Ignore Temp through P, those are subsets of Regime and are included, I just couldn't figure out how to pull them out of the code. So let's start with a model with all parameters.  

```{r All Parameters Aboard}
all<-lm(perDay ~ treatment + NED + regime + overlap + replicate, data = data)

results<-dredge(all)
results

subset(results, delta <5)

importance(results)
```

Replicate doesn't seem to be a useful predictor, let's drop it.   

```{r Minus Replicates}
results<-dredge(all, subset= !(replicate))
results
```

Models 17-24 all have equal explanatory power.
